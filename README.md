# Personal-Portfolio1

First personal portfolio website made from scratch. I started the design process with Figma outlines and built the website. Incorporates HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the GSAP animation library. This is my current portfolio website as of 1/10/2024. I will make a new one once I learn how to make better responsive websites.
